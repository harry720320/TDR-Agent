## 🤖 AI-Powered Response Analysis

The application now includes intelligent response analysis that converts raw API responses into clear, natural language explanations:

### Features:
- **Security Analysis**: AI analyzes threat data and provides professional security insights
- **Risk Assessment**: Explains threat severity levels and risk scores
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggests specific security actions to take
- **Non-Technical Language**: Converts technical data into manager-friendly explanations

### Example AI Analysis:
Instead of showing raw JSON data, the AI provides explanations like:
- "**Summary**: Your organization has 3 high-risk users with suspicious login patterns..."
- "**Key Findings**: User 'john.doe@company.com' has a risk score of 85/100 due to..."
- "**Recommendations**: Immediately investigate the anomalous login attempts from..."

### Configuration:
The AI analysis uses your configured OpenAI API key and model. Make sure to set these in the configuration panel for the best experience. The default model is GPT-5 Mini, which provides fast and efficient analysis.

**Supported Models:**
- GPT-5 Mini (default) - Fast and efficient
- GPT-4o - Latest multimodal model
- GPT-4o Mini - Compact version of GPT-4o
- GPT-4 Turbo - High-performance model
- GPT-3.5 Turbo - Legacy model

**Configuration Storage:**
- All configuration is stored in `tdr_config.json` file
- This file is automatically created when you save settings through the web interface
- Configuration is loaded automatically on application startup
- The file contains sensitive information (API tokens) and should not be committed to version control

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the API settings** (choose one method):

   **Method 1: Web Interface** (Recommended)
   - Start the application first
   - Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner
   - Enter your API hostname, token, and OpenAI settings
   - Click Save (settings are automatically saved to `tdr_config.json`)
   
   **Note**: The application uses HTTPS by default. If you need HTTP, specify the full URL (e.g., `http://api.example.com:8080`)

   **Method 2: Edit tdr_config.json directly**
   - Create or edit `tdr_config.json` file in the project root:
   ```json
   {
     "hostname": "api.example.com:8080",
     "api_token": "your_api_token_here",
     "api_base_url": "https://api.example.com:8080",
     "openai_api_key": "sk-your_openai_key_here",
     "openai_model": "gpt-5-mini"
   }
   ```
   - The configuration file will be automatically loaded on application startup

   **Method 3: Edit config.py directly** (For development only)
   ```python
   DEFAULT_HOSTNAME = "your-api-server.com:8080"
   DEFAULT_API_TOKEN = "your_api_token_here"
   DEFAULT_OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your_openai_key_here"  # Optional
   DEFAULT_OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-5-mini"  # Optional
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   **Windows Users**: If you encounter socket errors, use the Windows-specific launcher:
   ```bash
   start_windows.bat
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (Windows) or `http://localhost:5000` (Unix/Linux/Mac)

- **user_id**: Unique identifier for users
- **device_id**: Unique identifier for devices
- **alert_id**: Unique identifier for rare process alerts

## Configuration

### API Settings

The application requires configuration of the target API hostname and authentication token:

- **Hostname**: The hostname or IP address of your TDR API server (include port if needed)
- **API Token**: Authentication token that will be sent in the `X-API-KEY` header
- **OpenAI API Key** (Optional): For processing complex queries that don't match predefined patterns
- **OpenAI Model** (Optional): Choose between GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, or GPT-4 Turbo

**Protocol**: The application uses HTTPS by default for security. If your API server only supports HTTP, specify the full URL including the protocol (e.g., `http://api.example.com:8080`).

### Configuration Methods

1. **Web Interface** (Recommended - Easy setup):
   - Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the application header
   - Enter your hostname, token, and OpenAI settings
   - Click Save (settings are automatically saved to `tdr_config.json`)
   - Configuration is automatically loaded on next startup

2. **tdr_config.json File** (For production or direct configuration):
   - Create or edit `tdr_config.json` file in the project root directory
   - Add your configuration in JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "hostname": "api.example.com:8080",
     "api_token": "your_api_token_here",
     "api_base_url": "https://api.example.com:8080",
     "openai_api_key": "sk-your_openai_key_here",
     "openai_model": "gpt-5-mini"
   }
   ```
   - The application will automatically load this file on startup
   - **Note**: `tdr_config.json` contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control

3. **Direct Configuration** (For development only):
   - Edit `config.py` and update the `DEFAULT_HOSTNAME`, `DEFAULT_API_TOKEN`, and OpenAI settings
   - This method is less persistent and not recommended for production use

### How the Hybrid System Works

The application uses a two-tier approach for processing natural language queries:

1. **Rule-based Processing** (First Priority):
   - Fast, free, and works offline
   - Handles common query patterns like "show me risky users", "describe user123"
   - Uses regex patterns and keyword matching
   - Shows green "Rule-based" indicator

2. **AI-powered Processing** (Fallback):
   - Used when rule-based processing fails
   - Powered by OpenAI's language models
   - Handles complex, ambiguous, or creative queries
   - Shows purple "AI-powered" indicator with confidence score
   - Requires OpenAI API key and internet connection

**Examples of queries that trigger AI processing:**
- "I'm concerned about potential insider threats, can you help me investigate?"
- "What unusual activities happened around the time of the security incident?"
- "Show me users who might be compromised based on their recent behavior patterns"

## Development

To modify or extend the application:

1. **Add new query patterns** in the `_extract_intent` method of `NaturalLanguageProcessor`
2. **Modify parameter extraction** in the respective `_extract_*` methods
3. **Update the UI** by modifying the React components in `templates/index.html`
4. **Add new API endpoints** by updating the OpenAPI specification and corresponding processing logic

## Error Handling

The application provides helpful error messages and suggestions when:
- Queries cannot be understood
- Required parameters are missing
- Invalid parameter values are provided
- API requests fail

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Socket Errors

If you encounter `OSError: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket`:

1. **Use the Windows launcher**:
   ```bash
   start_windows.bat
   ```

2. **Check port availability**:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   ```

3. **Kill conflicting processes**:
   ```bash
   taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
   ```

4. **Change the port** in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, host='127.0.0.1', port=5001)  # Use different port
   ```

### Common Issues

- **Port already in use**: Change port or kill the conflicting process
- **OpenAI API errors**: Check your API key and internet connection
- **Module not found**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Permission denied**: Run as administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (Unix)
